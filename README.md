# Example Excerpt
Diagnostic Innovation
Digital Pathology: Deep learning models now routinely analyse whole-slide images, identifying malignant features with accuracy rivalling expert pathologists.
Radiomics: AI-led analysis of imaging data (CT, MRI, PET) extracts quantitative features (“radiomic signatures”) that can predict tumour subtype, stage, and even treatment response.
